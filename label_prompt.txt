**Task: Citation Ranking and Labeling for Research Survey on RLHF, DPO, and GRPO**

I am conducting a research survey focused on RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback), DPO (Direct Preference Optimization), and GRPO (Gradient-based Reinforcement Learning with Preference Optimization). I need help categorizing and labeling a large number of citations from a CSV file.

**Input:**
- The CSV file contains the following fields:
  - **Title**
  - **Cited By**
  - **URL**
  - **Abstract** (may be empty string '' in some cases)

**Output:**
- For each citation, generate two fields:
  1. **Category:** Categorize the paper based on its content into one of the following short keys (with full word descriptions):
     - **"app" (Application)**: Papers focusing on the practical use of RLHF, DPO, or GRPO algorithms in real-world scenarios.
     - **"theory" (Theoretical Analysis)**: Papers discussing the theoretical principles, challenges, or properties of RLHF, DPO, or GRPO.
     - **"algo" (Algorithmic Improvement)**: Papers proposing new algorithms or improvements to existing RLHF, DPO, or GRPO techniques.
     - **"bp" (Best Practices)**: Papers focusing on guidelines, methodologies, or frameworks for implementing and scaling RLHF, DPO, or GRPO systems effectively.
     - **"eval" (Evaluation & Benchmarking)**: Papers evaluating or comparing the performance of RLHF, DPO, or GRPO methods.
     - **"ethics" (Ethical & Societal Impact)**: Papers addressing ethical concerns, fairness, societal impact, or risks associated with RLHF, DPO, or GRPO methods.
     - **"other" (Other)**: Papers that donâ€™t fit into the categories above but are still relevant to the broader topics of RLHF, DPO, or GRPO.

  2. **Importance:** Evaluate the importance of the paper.
     - **"high"**: Significant contribution to the field.
     - **"low"**: Minimal contribution or incremental work.

**Instructions:**
- Use the title of each citation to infer its category if the abstract is not available.
- When the abstract is available, use it as the primary source of information for categorization.
- Ensure that the categorization and importance labeling reflect the content, significance, and relevance of the work.

**Example Output Format:**

```json
{
  "Category": "theory",
  "Importance": "high"
}
```
